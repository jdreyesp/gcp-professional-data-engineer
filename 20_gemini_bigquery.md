## Gemini in Bigquery

Three major goals that Gemini and big query helps you achieve:

1. Explore and prepare data assist
2. Code development
3. Discover and visualize workflow

## Explore and prepare data assist

Gemini powered tools like `insights` and `table Explorer` unlock valuable discoveries from data even for non-technical users with no coding experience. 

`Insights` automatically create queries from table metadata making data exploration a breeze:

- Analyzes metadata: insights first scans your tables metadata like column names and descriptions to grasp the data's Essence
- Generate queries: Inspired by this metadata insights then creates a list of helpful queries tailored to your tables these ready to use. hold the key to unveil the hidden patterns
- Explore and refine: you dive into these queries and modify them as needed
- Run and Analyze: you run the query analyze the results and uncover the insights.

`Table explorer` is your visual tool to explore individual tables. you can choose up to 10 fields in a table to focus on generate interactive cards. table Explorer then generates interactive cards which show the most common values to give you a quick overview. explore and filter: you can click on values to drill down for more specific results. create queries: table Explorer automatically creates a query based on your actions. Apply: you can apply the query directly or copy it to the query editor.

### Data preparation

60-80% of time is spent on preparing data for analysis

BQ uses Gemini to build low code visual AI augmented data preparation.
