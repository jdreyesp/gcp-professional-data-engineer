# Logging

- Job logs tab: Logs from Dataflow service
Workers logs tab: Logs from workers (VMs)

- Diagnosis tab: This tab shows the frequency of each error across time in your entire project, as well as when it was first seen and last seen.

- Bigquery tab: If your pipeline reads or write from / to BQ, an additional tab is shown here.

Error Reporting page: Error Reporting aggregates and displays errors produced in your running cloud services. For Dataflow, Error Reporting shows you your most frequent or new errors that occur across all the Dataflow pipelines in your project. You can see how many times the error occurred across a specific timeframe by pressing on the different time ranges on the top right. If your company has an issue tracker, you can link this error reporting page to it by pasting your issue tracker link.
